Software Engineering Fall 2015 Repo for practice exercises

Please carefully follow the exercise specifications when they are released.

## Groups

To reduce the number of merge conflicts that individual students have to deal with, we have decided to create 6 branches of ~10 people each. You will contribute to the branch that you are assigned to in the following list. To make it easier, you may want to coordinate with your group each push, so that you are not all trying to push at the same time.

Here are the groups
