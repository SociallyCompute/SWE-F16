Cryptozoologists are a specialized branch of monster hunters.
The more a creature shows evidence of being supernatural, the less likely it is that cryptozoologists would be interested in it.
As they kissed, an Eagle whisked them away to a Castle where the evil Warlock was.
As they came to the castle, the Warlock greeted them with an evil laugh.

Have you tried Ebay?------One of this friend asked
there was a link, a missing link that is, called 404.

Emerging after his birthday dip in the Mississippi River, Linus had morphed into a giant red salamander resembling a popular creature known as a Charmander.
The wizard's name was Albus Percival Wolfrick Brian Dumbledore.

According to cryptozoology and certain other branches of fringe science, a few dinosaurs might have survived much longer, or could even be around today
Suddenly some aliens showed up and started putting all the other cryptozoological creatures under mind controlThe aliens turned the creatures into a strange and epic circus for their own amusement. Albus jumped up, ripped off his shirt, and screamed this one is for #Harambe!
There was a fairy princes named Princess Cleo who granted Albus one wish in exchange for the fang of a vampire.

The end.
