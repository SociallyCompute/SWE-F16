Once upon a time


In a galaxy far far away
Cryptozoologists are a specialized branch of monster hunters.
Cryptozoology is a thankless job, condemed by 'Mainstream' science, but requred for the saftey of the world.
The more a creature shows evidence of being supernatural, the less likely it is that cryptozoologists would be interested in it.
A pair of cryptozoologists had just retired, swearing of monsterhunting forever. Little did they know that they would be drawn into an entirly new adventure
As they kissed, an Eagle whisked them away to a Castle where the evil Warlock was.
As they came to the castle, the Warlock greeted them with an evil laugh.
there was a link, a missing link that is, called 404.

He just wanted to tell you how he was feeling, had to make you understand, that he was never going to give you up or let you down.
Emerging after his birthday dip in the Mississippi River, Linus had morphed into a giant red salamander resembling a popular creature known as a Charmander.
Linus desperately searched for a last bit of energy that he knew he was going to need.
The wizard's name was Albus Percival Wolfrick Brian Dumbledore.

'How dare you?!?' barked the witch at Linus, who having been returned to his human form kissed her.
And he was desperately looking for a pair of shoes to keep his feet warm during the winter.
Have you tried Ebay?------One of this friend asked
I don't like ebay, said bigfoot. Personally, I've always been an amazon fan. Suddenly, A dangerous group of ninjas arrived, they were capable of killing dinosaurs with their bare hands!
It seemed like all was lost, and the ninjas would bring about the extinction of dinosaurs.
Luckly, skilled Samaris came to the help, but the Samaris' used their katanas to make sushi and their blades were dull!
So the samurais decided to borrow Ned Stark's Valyrian Steel sword.
However Ned's sword, Ice, had been melted down by Tywin Lannister, so the samurai contacted their evil friends, who were inflatable hamsters, to help.
A Mexican Ruffed Cat, whose name is sebastian, was fed up with all of the commotion going on outside his home and he went to investigate
When he crept outside, everyone was immediately atonished; no one had seen a Mexican Ruffed Cat for nearly 50 years.
 The lochness monster was really excited for her dance party later. Her date was a wizard with a great looking beard.An African peacock appeared and turned into the form of a witch.According to mainstream science, the dinosaurs dies out about 65 million years ago
According to cryptozoology and certain other branches of fringe science, a few dinosaurs might have survived much longer, or could even be around today
Suddenly, A mysterious unicorn appeared from the sky, and landed. Looking at all the mess that has been made, the unicorn then said, 'This world is just all messed up and someone needs to fix the mess someone made.'
Time starts flowing backwards, all the way to the begining of time. Trees start growing backwards, animals and people start moving backwards, and in a blink, everything was back as how it was.
Everyone fell silent as the situation got more and more uncomfortable.
Suddenly some aliens showed up and started putting all the other cryptozoological creatures under mind controlThe aliens turned the creatures into a strange and epic circus for their own amusement. There was a great programming ninja named Linus Torvald.
With his wizardry he robbed the corporate witches and warlocks of much of their power. 
He saved many a hassle with his amazing powers

However, he forgot to save 15% or more on car insurance!!
The alien big cats were closing in on Linus Torvald quickly. 
The warlocks and witches got drunk off their britches. 

The end.
