Once upon a time


there was a link, a missing link that is, called 404.

He just wanted to tell you how he was feeling, had to make you understand, that he was never going to give you up or let you down.
Emerging after his birthday dip in the Mississippi River, Linus had morphed into a giant red salamander resembling a popular creature known as a Charmander.
The wizard's name was Albus Percival Wolfrick Brian Dumbledore.

'How dare you?!?' barked the witch at Linus, who having been returned to his human form kissed her.
There was a bigfoot living in an mountain.
And he was desperately looking for a pair of shoes to keep his feet warm during the winter.
Because of his unsual size of feet, he couldn't find one in the local town
Have you tried Ebay?------One of this friend asked
I don't like ebay, said bigfoot. Personally, I've always been an amazon fan. Suddenly, A dangerous group of ninjas arrived, they were capable of killing dinosaurs with their bare hands!
Luckly, skilled Samaris came to the help, but the Samaris' used their katanas to make sushi and their blades were dull!
 The lochness monster was really excited for her dance party later. Her date was a wizard with a great looking beard.An African peacock appeared and turned into the form of a witch.According to mainstream science, the dinosaurs dies out about 65 million years ago
According to cryptozoology and certain other branches of fringe science, a few dinosaurs might have survived much longer, or could even be around today
Suddenly, A mysterious unicorn appeared from the sky, and landed. Looking at all the mess that has been made, the unicorn then said, 'This world is just all messed up and someone needs to fix the mess someone made.'
Time starts flowing backwards, all the way to the begining of time. Trees start growing backwards, animals and people start moving backwards, and in a blink, everything was back as how it was.

The end.
